	  <h1> Motivation </h1>
<p>
As part of the GlussCon project, we needed linear position (or linear length) sensor.
We used slide potentiometers for this purpose.  However, these were limited in the sizes
that we were able to purchase. 
</p>
<p>
We are exploring the possibility of making linear position or length sensors based on using light that
may have a number of advantages. These advantages potentially include:
<ul>
<li>
Complete customizability of size
<li>
Possibility of 3D printing multiple connected units simultaneously
<li>
Possibly obtaining greater accuracy
<li>
Possibly obtaining greater performance in other ways
</ul>
</p>
