# Optical Linear Sensor

Early stage attempt to research the creation of an optical linear sensor.

We've written a short [technical paper](https://github.com/PubInv/optical-linear-sensor/blob/master/doc/OpticalDisplacementSensor.pdf).

As of August 2018, this project is closed, though we invite other to expand on it or reopen it.
