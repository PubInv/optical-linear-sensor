% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
%  declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{figures}}
%  and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
%  every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Displacement sensors measure the change in position of a physical object attached to the sensor. Instruments, such as linear slide potentiometers are inexpensive and robust when such a physical connection is not a problem or even an advantage. However, the currently manufactured slide potentiometers offer only a limited number of size and range choices. Driven by the need to allow arbitrary ranges of displacements and to scale to larger and smaller displacements, we experimented with a simple, inexpensive approach using LEDs and light sensors in a 3D printed chamber. When calibrated in software, the resulting system seems a practical, inexpensive approach to producing displacements sensors of scales larger than and smaller than 10 cm.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

This research grew out of our need to make small sensors of specific sizes which we were unable to easily source.  We are in fact building a net or framework rods which can change their length. This is a “puppet” or “waldo” controller for a larger robot in the same geometry, constructed out of linear actuators. The resulting waldo can be manipulated by hand to cause a corresponding motion in the larger robot. It is like playing with a doll or action figure, to effect a realistic motion.

Ideally, we would be able to construct this “waldo” out of sliding rods that can change their length in any size that we desire. Since we combine the joints using a special joint, the Kwon-Song-Kim joint, that can only be created by 3D printing, it is natural for us to seek a 3D printable solution, even though of course in a perfect world one might order a sensor of any size that could be manufactured with a wide variety of techniques.


\subsection{Mechanism}

In open space, the intensity of light falling on a sensor is inversely proportional to the square of the distance travelled between the source and sensor. When encased in a tube, some fraction of the light is reflected off the walls of the tube, so the light reaching the sensor is does not have a simple mathematical relationship with displacement. However, it is monotone---the light intensity decreases smoothly with increasing displacement, even if the rate of decrease is not easily predictable. Since we always intended to read our sensor value with a microcontroller such as an Arduino, it is simple to perform calibration in software. By using a simple light-and-sensor mechanism in a sliding cylinder with a reflective piston, we construct a displacement sensor with few limits on scaling up or scaling down. By putting the sensor and the light at the same end, we simplify the wiring, although this requires a reflection of the light.


\section{Construction of the Sensor}

We started by gathering the basic materials needed to make the sensor operational. An Arduino Uno microcontroller for its analog to digital converter, an LED as a light source, and a CdS cell for light detection,such as comes with the Arduino Experimenter’s Kit (ARDX) from Adafruit. First, the LED and CdS cell were physically measured and created in AutoDesk Inventor. Then a housing unit was created for the LED and CdS cell with a baffle to separate them so that the LEd did not directly shine on the Cds cell. A piston and cylinder were created to for the housing. Tolerances were checked for the CAD model and then the models were 3D printed. We powered the CdS at 5V and the LED at 3.3V using the Arduino Uno. A resistor was added to the LED circuit to prevent it burning out. The CdS cell was voltage was read by the analog input of the Uno. This procedure was repeated for a smaller version of the sensor as well. In theory the cylinder size can be parametrically controlled to a large number of physical lengths and even diameters.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/Expanded.png}
  \caption{Expanded View}  
\end{figure}


\section{Electrical Performance}

The charts below show the measured voltage at the CdS cell based on physical change in the displacement of the piston within the cylinder. Initially, we performed a regression analysis, but it soon became clear that digital calibration would be preferred. There was in all cases a smooth monotone relationship between output signal voltage and the position of the piston as seen in the diagrams below. 

Each plot plots the linear displacement as the vertical (Y) axis. In the large sensor this is measured in centimeters. The horizontal line is the digital read of the analog input returned by the Uno, on a scale of 0 to 1023, which is in fact proportional to the voltage via the formula: V = (input * 1000 milivolts)/ 5 = input * 200 millivolts. An digital read of 1000 corresponds to 5V. In the case of the smaller sensor, the scale of displacement is measured in mm.

Observe that using a aluminum foil as the reflector in the large model “linearized” the curve and allowed better separation of values at large displacements of 15 cm or more.

Note that this depends on the bore diameter, the reflectance of the piston head, the kind of LED and CDS cell, as well as the input voltage.

\section{Digital Calibration}

\end{figure}


Because the voltage produced by the optical linear sensor is in the common ranges of 0-5V, it is easy to digitize the signal with a standard Analog-to-Digital converter or common hobbyist microcontrollers, such as the Arduino. Although some sensors are carefully designed to allow a directly meaningful voltage level to be output, we assumed that in most cases our sensors would be used by a microcontroller anyway.

The procedure was to wire the LED, photocell, and resistor to the Arduino. A simple Arduino script was used to sample the photocell’s voltage divider once every second. The ADC value from the serial output of the Arduino was recorded for every 1 centimeter from 0 cm to 26 cm.

The results of the experiment were recorded in an excel sheet. Since the Arduino uses a 12 bit ADC, the output of the serial reading range from 0 to 1023. The equation [(measurement)/1023 * 5] was used to map the ADC value to a voltage. 

We have produced Arduino code that performs a simple linear interpolation of data points recorded by hand. The code is available in our GitHub repo: (https://github.com/PubInv/optical-linear-sensor) under the GNU Public License.

\section{Future Work}

This paper explains how to make a calibratable displacement sensor using light intensity as its fundamental mechanism.  

A number of interesting improvements are in theory possible. Perhaps the best, since we are already using 3D printing, is to attempt to create a “digital” displacement 


From this baseline concept of having light as a means of detecting distance, many directions can be taken to improve upon or modify the design for future iterations of the sensor. For instance, in order to decrease the overall footprint of the device, fiber optics could be used to transmit light into a smaller tube rather than having the led taking up space in the tube itself. This would make the circumference of the tube smaller, potentially opening the device to other applications. 

Also, there is potential to make the system digital by changing the geometry of the inside of the tube. Instead of having a hollow tube, chambers and cavities could be made to “catch” the light at a precise distance. This would carry on for multiple intervals and in theory when the light hits one of the cavities there would be a sharp drop in reflectivity and the photocell would be able to detect the change in intensity and distance. 

There are many more directions that could be taken with the optical linear sensor concept and with each modification, a different use for the device could be discovered.


\section{Conclusion}

This paper describes a means of constructing linear position sensors of widely-varying (human-scale) size with 3D printing and cheap electronics components. This invention is released under a Creative Commons license. Because it does not use physical contact as in most pressure sensors or linear potentiometers, it may have advantages in reliability. Because it utilizes only inexpensive electronic components, it may be constructed for a custom length easily via 3D printing or custom cylinder construction by anyone with hobby-level skills. Additionally, we invite other researchers to improve upon this design, as outlined in Future Work.

Very useful article about terminology of sensors:


http://www.machinedesign.com/sensors/finding-right-sensor-linear-displacement

Possibly: linear displacement transducer

https://www.omega.com/technical-learning/linear-variable-displacement-transducers.html 

“Linear variable displacement transducer” - LVDT

Here is a product not customizable, comes in 10mm and 25mm
https://opsens-solutions.com/products/fiber-optic-displacement-sensors/

Useful general article on sensors:
http://www.ni.com/white-paper/3638/en/

Old article for fiber optic displacement:

Note: The term “long stroke” is used to refer to sensors capable of measuring long displacements.

“linear variable displacement sensor long stroke” reveals some valuable results:
